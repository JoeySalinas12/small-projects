# Small Projects

## Overview
This repo contains small scripts that I have created either as a side project or simply as a bit of reusable code that I may wish to reuse in the future. As of right now there isn't a huge need for multiple directories, but I imagine that as this repo becomes more and more filled it will make more sense to organize things a bit more thoroughly.

## Contents

_decoder.py:_ Takes a string of characters and returns a new string where each letter is shifted backwards (based on its position in the alphabet) by a specified number of positions.
	- e.g. if "FDW" is provided and the displacement value is 3, then the returned value is "cat".
